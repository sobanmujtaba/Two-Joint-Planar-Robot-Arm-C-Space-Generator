# Two-Joint-Planar-Robot-Arm-C-Space-Generator
This is an interactive web application designed to visualize and calculate the Configuration Space (C-Space) for a 2-link planar revolute robotic arm. This tool is fundamental for understanding motion planning and robotics kinematics, particularly in collision avoidance.
